# Spec: `generate_response()`

**File:** `generator.py`
**Status:** Spec incomplete — fill in all blank fields before implementing

---

## Purpose

Given a user query and a list of retrieved rule chunks, generate a response that directly answers the question using only the retrieved text as context. The response must be grounded — it should not draw on the model's general knowledge of board games, only on what was retrieved.

---

## Input / Output Contract

**Inputs:**

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `query` | `str` | The user's original question |
| `retrieved_chunks` | `list[dict]` | Ranked list of chunks from `retrieve()`, each with `"text"`, `"game"`, and `"distance"` |

**Output:** `str`

A plain string containing the response to show the user. The response should:
- Answer the question using only the retrieved rule text
- Identify which game the answer comes from
- Acknowledge clearly when the answer is not found in the loaded rules

Returns a fallback string (not an error) when `retrieved_chunks` is empty.

## Design Decisions

*Complete the fields below before writing any code. Use your AI tool in Plan or Ask mode to help you reason through what belongs here — but the decisions are yours.*

---

### Context formatting

*How will you format the retrieved chunks before passing them to the LLM? Describe the structure — not the code. Consider: will you label chunks by game? Include distance scores? Separate chunks with delimiters?*

```
[your answer here]
```

---

### System prompt — grounding instruction

*Write the exact system prompt instruction you will use to prevent the model from answering beyond the retrieved text. This is the most important design decision in this function.*

```
[your answer here]
I will write it should only answer based on the answered data rather than create it's own, if not in training data, then say I don't know
```

---

### System prompt — citation instruction

*Write the exact instruction you will use to tell the model to identify which game its answer comes from.*

```
[your answer here]
Only answered based on the training data, if the question not in the training data, answer I don't know
```

---

### Fallback behavior

*What should the response say when the answer isn't found in the loaded rule books? Write the exact fallback message.*

```
[your answer here]
I don't know
```

---

### Handling low-relevance chunks

*`retrieved_chunks` may include chunks with high distance scores (weak relevance). Will you filter these out before building context, pass them all in, or handle them another way? What are the tradeoffs?*

```
[your answer here]
If distance >0.5, say, based on what the understand I know, but please take it with a grain of salt and then answer the question
```

---

### Message structure

*Describe how you will structure the messages list for the API call — what goes in the system message vs. the user message?*

```
[your answer here]
show all the important detailed like chunkId, distance in system to easy to debug and show answer on user side
```

## Implementation Notes

*Fill this in after implementing and testing.*

**Test query and response:**

```
Query: [your test query]
Response: [abbreviated response]
Correctly grounded? [yes / no]
Cited the right game? [yes / no]
```
